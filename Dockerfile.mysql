# Keep common instructions at the top of the Dockerfile to utilize the cache.
# The ARG instruction lets Dockerfile authors define values that users can set at build-time using the --build-arg flag. This flag allows you to pass the build-time variables that are accessed like regular environment variables in the RUN instruction of the Dockerfile. Also, these values donâ€™t persist in the intermediate or final images like ENV values do.
